            <span style="font-family: 'PT Serif', serif;">
                <p>Near the beginning of the 23rd century, The Lunar Joint Observatory detected a gravity wave signal from the direction of Barnard’s Star expanding through the solar system at the speed of light. Ten seconds later, a second identical signal appeared, then a third, then a fourth. Up to a hundred broadcasts were detected, each around ten seconds apart, all identical in content. The next day, it was made official: humanity had received a message from an alien civilization. </p>
                <p>The scientific community worked hard the following days to find meaning in the signal. For a while it seemed that this Pandora's Box did not want to be opened, for no matter what technique was used to decode it, from simple binary images to advanced cryptanalysis, the message would not reveal its secret. About a week later, a breakthrough was made: if the message was decoded into blocks of numbers, the ratio of some of the numbers matched the ratios of the orbital distances of the planets in the solar system. The other numbers were examined, and as expected, the values were consistent with planetary properties such as mass and size. The purpose of the message was finally known: it was a detailed survey of the solar system. </p>
                <p>A few months later, a small building-sized object was detected near the Oort Cloud, traveling at nearly 40% the speed of light. The object was detected almost by pure luck, detectable only as it reflected a faint but visible speck of sunlight which gradually grew brighter as it approached the sun. There was a brief excitement, which quickly turned into dread after a shocking realization: the object was not slowing down. When the news was released, panic ensued, many fearing that the object was a relativistic weapon aimed at Earth. At its current speed, an impact with Earth would—in an instant—release the combined energy of every thermonuclear detonation and thermonuclear device humanity ever created one-hundred thousand times over. As humanity did not possess the technology to feasibly evacuate the Earth, everyone could only helplessly watch as the object sped into the solar system.</p>
                <p>The object did not crash into Earth as most expected. Instead it first collided with Saturn, releasing a brilliant flash of light that outshone Venus in the night sky. Less than an hour later, it emerged from the other side, creating a second flash, only slightly dimmer than the first. Astronomers now noted that the object had not only significantly reduced in speed, but emerged in a completely different orbital trajectory. At its current distance, precise path predictions could be made, and the object was now expected to collide with Jupiter in about 43 days. Humanity held its breath as finally, the object disappeared into Jupiter’s atmosphere. The collision caused massive ripples on Jupiter’s surface, but this time, the collision was only visible with powerful telescopes. Around the world, everyone let out a sigh of relief. </p>
                <p>Humanity never discovered the true nature of the object. Hidden deep in the depths of the gas giant, the object consumed the heavy elements and metallic hydrogen in the core of Jupiter, extracting energy through an exotic form of heavy-element fusion. Once the object was sufficiently powered, it tethered itself to a far away alien ship.</p>
                <p>This tether was not made of physical matter. Rather, it was a gluon superstructure, an impossible string with a tensile strength of infinity. This was because it was bonded together by the strongest of the fundamental forces; a force 10 to the 38th power times stronger than the gravitational power of a black hole. Despite its strength, it was thinner than an atomic nucleus, being a perfect physical representation of a geometric line. As it shot out of the core of Jupiter at the speed of light, space itself was sliced in half, cut by an invisible obsidian blade. </p>
                <p>As part of the string’s engineering, the string decreased in density the further one progressed away from the source. This caused the string to “stiffen” the closer the ship approached, which gradually decelerated the ship to non-relativistic speeds. To an outside observer, it would appear that the ship was violating Newton’s laws of motion.</p>
                <p>It didn’t take long for humans to notice the decelerating ship. Upon this discovery, the gravity wave message finally made sense—it was a detailed survey of the solar system sent by the probe to the mothership. And as it was almost certain that its scan would have detected life on Earth, the aliens must be at the very least aware of humanity’s existence, possibly even desiring to communicate. While some feared a hostile invader, it was logical that the aliens must be benevolent, as they are at a technological level capable of destroying Earth, but haven’t done so. After all, why would such an advanced star-faring race even bother exterminating such lowly civilizations? So the human race got to work composing a detailed message to establish contact.</p>
                <p>After a seemingly endless number of conferences, a message was finalized. The message contained 5,156 binary images and diagrams summarizing life on Earth, humanity’s cultures and technology, and desires for peace and mutual cooperation. As humans lacked the technology to generate gravity wave broadcasts, the message was sent as a radio wave broadcast. In the eyes of the aliens, such a broadcast must seem as primitive as smoke signaling.</p>
                <p>After the message was sent, humans around the world rejoiced. A stubborn few feared destruction from a superior race, but many anticipated that the alien’s advanced technology and culture would solve the problems that plagued human culture since the dawn of civilization. Surprisingly, most religions did not view this event as religiously significant, even openly welcoming the extraterrestrial visitors.</p>
                <p>Months later, the alien ship passed by the Earth at around 60x the distance of the moon. Everyone was watching the sky that day.</p>
                <p>Despite observations of the ship being released many months beforehand, the appearance of the ship surprised everyone. Gravitational observations had demonstrated the ship was a hollow ellipsoid, nearly the size of Madagascar, rotating slowly along its minor axis. Its surface was perfectly black, absorbing a measured 100% of all wavelengths of light, which made any details on the ship, including a propulsion system, invisible. The spaceship’s design was the very embodiment of simplicity; compared to the crude approximations of the world around it, its geometry was perfectly defined, every point exactly placed by an infinitely precise mathematical formula. Such a level of perfection seemed completely beyond humanity.</p>
                <p>Everyone waited patiently for the ship to drop into an orbit around the Earth, but it did not attempt to retrograde, instead continuing on a hyperbolic trajectory towards the center of the solar system. Everyone stared in disbelief, expecting the ship to turn back, until it finally broke the surface of the sun. The world collectively realized one undeniable fact: the ship’s target had never been Earth.</p>
